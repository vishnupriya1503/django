In the two examples provided, the key difference between POST and GET requests lies in how data is transmitted from the client (browser) to the server and how the server processes that data

GET Request:

    In the first example, the form uses a GET request to submit the data to the server.
    When a GET request is used, the data from the form is appended to the URL as query parameters.
    For example, if you select a password length of 12 characters, enable uppercase and numbers, and submit the form, the URL might look something like this:
        http://localhost:8000/password/?length=12&uppercase=on&numbers=on

    The data is visible in the URL, making it easy to bookmark or share, but it's less secure because it's exposed in the browser's address bar.
    In the password view, you retrieve the form data using 
        request.GET.get("parameter_name").

POST Request:

    In the second example, the form uses a POST request to submit the data to the server.
    When a POST request is used, the data is sent in the request body rather than being appended to the URL.
    This method is more secure because the data is not visible in the URL, but it's not as easy to bookmark or share.
    In the password view, you retrieve the form data using 
        request.POST.get("parameter_name").

        http://localhost:8000/password/

In summary:

    Use GET requests when you want to retrieve data from the server or when the data is not sensitive, and you don't mind it being visible in the URL.
    Use POST requests when you want to send data to the server, especially when dealing with sensitive information like passwords or when the data is too large to fit in a URL.
    
    In web development, the choice between GET and POST requests depends on the specific use case and the requirements of the application.
